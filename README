This is a nagios/iCinga2 plugin meant to check the status of portsentry.  It will confirm it is running, and either
(without the -d flag) check current bans and quit, or (with the -d flag) check how many new bans have occured since
15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes ago as decided by the -t flag.

It reports the results via human-readable text and perfdata for graphing.

This has only been tested with iCinga2.

This was done as a learning project by a near-beginner.   The code is amateurish, but functional.

I make no promises with it, though.

If you make any changes to make it better, please e-mail me at bugs at imagination-works dot com or submit the change
to github.
